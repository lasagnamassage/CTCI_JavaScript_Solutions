/**
 * Partition a linked-list around a value x,
 * such that all nodes less than x come before
 * all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x
 * is contained within the list, the values of x
 * only need to be right after the elements less than s.
 * The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition";
 * It doesn't need to appear between the left and right partitions.
 * Example: 
 *  Input = 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
 *  Output = 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
 * @todo Figure out what the hell this even means.
